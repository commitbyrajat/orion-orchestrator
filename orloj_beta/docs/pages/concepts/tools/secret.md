# Secret

A **Secret** stores sensitive values (API keys, tokens, passwords) used by other resources. ModelEndpoints, Tools, McpServers, and TaskWebhooks reference Secrets for authentication.

If you need to commit encrypted secret manifests to git, use [SealedSecret](../../reference/resources/sealed-secret.md). `SealedSecret` is decrypted by `orlojd` and reconciled into a normal `Secret`, while consumers continue to reference the generated `Secret`.

## Defining a Secret

The simplest way to create a Secret is with the CLI:

```bash
orlojctl create secret openai-api-key --from-literal value=sk-your-api-key-here
```

Or with a YAML manifest:

```yaml
apiVersion: orloj.dev/v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: openai-api-key
spec:
  stringData:
    value: sk-your-api-key-here
```

### Key Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `data` | Base64-encoded key-value pairs. This is what the runtime reads at execution time. |
| `stringData` | Write-only plaintext convenience input. Entries are base64-encoded into `data` during normalization, then cleared. |

## How Secrets Work

- `stringData` entries are merged into `data` as base64 during normalization.
- Every `data` value must be non-empty valid base64.
- `stringData` is cleared after normalization (write-only behavior) -- it is never stored or returned by the API.
- Secret resolution is performed fresh per tool invocation. There is no caching of raw secret values, so rotated secrets take effect immediately.

## Environment Variable Override

In production, you can skip `Secret` resources entirely and inject values via environment variables:

```
ORLOJ_SECRET_<name>=<value>
```

See [Secret Handling](../../operations/security.md#secret-handling) for details.
