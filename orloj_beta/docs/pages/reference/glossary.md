# Glossary

Canonical definitions for terms used throughout Orloj documentation.

## A

**Agent**
A declarative unit of work backed by a language model. Defined as a resource with a prompt, model configuration, tool bindings, role assignments, and execution limits. See [Agents and Agent Systems](../concepts/agents/agent.md).

**Agent System**
A composition of multiple agents wired into a directed graph. The graph defines how messages flow between agents during task execution. Supports pipeline, hierarchical, and swarm-loop topologies. See [Agents and Agent Systems](../concepts/agents/agent-system.md).

**Agent Policy**
A governance resource that constrains agent execution. Can restrict allowed models, block specific tools, and cap token usage. Policies may be scoped to specific systems/tasks or applied globally. See [Governance and Policies](../concepts/governance/agent-policy.md).

**Agent Role**
A named set of permission strings that can be bound to agents. Agents accumulate the union of permissions from all bound roles. See [Governance and Policies](../concepts/governance/agent-role.md).

## B

**Blueprint**
A ready-to-use template combining agents, an agent system, and a task for a specific orchestration pattern (pipeline, hierarchical, or swarm-loop). Available in `examples/blueprints/`. See [Starter Blueprints](../guides/starter-blueprints.md).

## C

**Server**
The management layer of Orloj, running as `orlojd`. Includes the API server, resource store, background services, and task scheduler. See [Architecture Overview](../concepts/architecture.md).

**Resource Definition**
A typed, declarative schema. Orloj resources use standard `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `spec`, and `status` fields. See [Resource Reference](./resources/).

## D

**Dead Letter**
A terminal state for tasks or messages that have exhausted all retry attempts. Dead-lettered items require manual investigation. Tasks transition `Failed -> DeadLetter` after all retries are consumed.

## E

**Edge**
A directional connection between two agents in an AgentSystem graph. Edges define message routing. The `edges[]` field supports fan-out (multiple targets) and metadata annotations via labels and policy.

**EvalDataset**
A resource containing a list of (input, expected output) sample pairs with optional scoring rubrics. Datasets are referenced by EvalRun resources to drive agent evaluations. See [Agent Evaluation](../concepts/evaluation/).

**EvalRun**
A resource that executes all samples in an EvalDataset against an AgentSystem, scores the results, and produces aggregate metrics (pass rate, mean score, latency, tokens). Supports `exact_match`, `llm_judge`, `manual`, and `custom` scoring strategies. See [Agent Evaluation](../concepts/evaluation/).

## F

**Fan-in**
A graph pattern where multiple upstream branches converge on a single downstream node. Controlled by join gates with `wait_for_all` or `quorum` modes. See [Execution and Messaging](../concepts/execution-model.md).

**Fan-out**
A graph pattern where a single node routes messages to multiple downstream targets simultaneously.

## G

**Governance**
The authorization and policy enforcement layer. Composed of AgentPolicy, AgentRole, and ToolPermission resources. Governance is fail-closed: unauthorized actions are denied, not silently ignored. See [Governance and Policies](../concepts/governance/).

## J

**Join Gate**
A fan-in mechanism on an AgentSystem graph node. Modes: `wait_for_all` (wait for every upstream branch) or `quorum` (wait for a count/percentage). Configurable failure policy: `deadletter`, `skip`, or `continue_partial`.

## L

**Lease**
A time-bounded claim on a task held by a worker. Workers renew leases via heartbeats during execution. If a lease expires (worker crash, network partition), another worker may safely take over the task.

## M

**Memory**
A resource that configures a persistent memory backend for agents. Agents attach a Memory resource via `spec.memory.ref`, and may explicitly grant built-in memory operations with `spec.memory.allow` (`read`, `write`, `search`, `list`, `ingest`). Configured with a type, provider (e.g. `in-memory`, `pgvector`), and optional embedding model. Memory operates in three layers: conversation history (per-activation), task-scoped shared store (per-task), and persistent backends (cross-task). See [Memory](../concepts/memory/index.md).

**Memory Tool**
One of five built-in runtime tools that can be exposed when an agent both references a Memory resource and explicitly allows the corresponding operation: `memory.read`, `memory.write`, `memory.search`, `memory.list`, and `memory.ingest`. These are handled internally by the runtime without network calls. See [Memory](../concepts/memory/index.md).

**Message Bus**
The transport layer for agent-to-agent communication within a task. Implementations: `memory` (in-process) and `nats-jetstream` (durable). Messages carry lifecycle phase, retry state, and routing metadata.

**Model Endpoint**
A resource that configures a connection to a model provider. Declares the provider type, base URL, default model, provider-specific options, and auth credentials. Agents reference endpoints by name via `model_ref`. See [Model Routing](../concepts/tools/model-endpoint.md).

**Model Gateway**
The worker component that routes model requests to the appropriate provider based on agent configuration. Handles provider-specific request formatting and response parsing.

## N

**Namespace**
A scope for resource names. Defaults to `default`. Resources can reference cross-namespace targets using `namespace/name` syntax.

## R

**Reconciliation**
The process by which background services observe the current state of a resource and take actions to move it toward the desired state declared in `spec`.

## S

**Secret**
A resource for storing sensitive values (API keys, tokens). `stringData` values are base64-encoded into `data` during normalization and then cleared. The runtime reads from `data` at execution time.

## T

**Task**
A request to execute an AgentSystem with specific input. Tasks move through phases: `Pending -> Running -> Succeeded | Failed | DeadLetter`. See [Tasks and Scheduling](../concepts/tasks/task.md).

**Task Schedule**
A resource that creates tasks on a cron-based schedule from a template task. Supports timezone configuration, concurrency policy, and history limits. See [Tasks and Scheduling](../concepts/tasks/task-schedule.md).

**Task Webhook**
A resource that creates tasks in response to external HTTP events. Supports signature verification (generic and GitHub profiles) and idempotency-based deduplication. See [Tasks and Scheduling](../concepts/tasks/task-webhook.md).

**Tool**
An external capability that agents can invoke during execution. Defined as a resource with endpoint, auth, risk level, and runtime configuration (isolation, timeout, retry). See [Tools and Isolation](../concepts/tools/tool.md).

**Tool Contract v1**
The standardized JSON request/response envelope that all tools must implement. Defines the error taxonomy (`tool_code`, `tool_reason`, `retryable`) used by the runtime for retry decisions. See [Tool](../concepts/tools/tool.md).

**Tool Permission**
A governance resource that defines what permissions are required to invoke a specific tool. Checked against the agent's accumulated role permissions at execution time. See [Governance and Policies](../concepts/governance/tool-permission.md).

## W

**Worker**
An execution unit that claims and runs tasks. Workers register capabilities (region, GPU, supported models) and the scheduler uses these for task matching. Runs as `orlojworker`. See [Tasks and Scheduling](../concepts/infrastructure/worker.md) and [Architecture Overview](../concepts/architecture.md).
